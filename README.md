This is a passion project for myself. I wanted a keyboard that matched my needs exactly, while also being a unique representation of my interests.

The things I wanted from a keyboard:
-Has almost every key without needing to rely on layers. I'm not a fan of layers, and while it isn't so bad for just typing, I tend to run into issues with small keyboards when trying to do specific key combos for video games.
-Can be smaller than my 60-65% keyboards in order to free up more mouse space.
-Is more ergonomic on my wrists than normal keyboards when typing for long periods of time.
-Has a unique visual style that represents myself.

The need for better keyboard ergonomics alone was enough to settle on a split keyboard. After deciding on split, it became obvious that even though I would be putting more keys on it than a lot of split keyboards I have seen, each half would still end up being smaller than my current keyboards. The decision to have split wireless was a result of wanting to get the most mobility out of the right half so that I could put it wherever I wanted while gaming without being limited bt the length of a trrs cable.

Right around the time I was becoming interested in making a keyboard, the KBDCraft Adam was released and I fell in love with the idea of a Lego keyboard. I knew my keyboard needed a Lego case in order to truly be "my" keyboard.

After a year of on an off working on it, This is the final product. A nice!nano v2 powered split wireless keyboard that has 97 keys, an fr4 top plate, does not rely on layers, and is built inside a Lego case. I have plans to add a pair of nice!views and a protective window to each half when they are back in stock, but besides that they're done. They are everything I could've hoped for, and with only a few minor exceptions, there's nothing I would ever want to change about them, except maybe updating the look of the case over time since it is made of Legos and can easily be rebuilt as I want.
